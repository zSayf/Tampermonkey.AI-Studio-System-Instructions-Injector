## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **‚ö° Instant, Flicker-Free Check**: On page load and when switching between chats, the script instantly checks if your instructions are already present by reading the UI directly. The button **only appears if needed**, giving you a clean workspace.
*   **üß† SPA-Aware**: Fully compatible with AI Studio's single-page application design. The script automatically re-evaluates each chat you navigate to, ensuring context-aware functionality.
*   **üöÄ One-Shot Workflow**: A single click on the sleek UI button is all it takes. It opens the panel, injects your text, closes the panel, and hides itself for maximum efficiency.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Safety First**: Intelligently detects if the instruction field already has text. Instead of blindly overwriting, it presents a clear confirmation dialog (`Overwrite` / `Cancel`) to protect your work.
*   **üé® Professional UI**: Replaces all native browser dialogs with a custom-themed, professional UI that matches the AI Studio aesthetic, including non-blocking toast notifications.
*   **üîß Total Control & Customization**:
    *   **First Run Setup**: On first use, you'll be prompted to set your own instructions.
    *   **Easy Editing**: Edit saved instructions anytime via a right-click on the button or through the Tampermonkey menu.
    *   **Closable Button**: Don't want to see the button? A small `X` allows you to hide it for the current session or permanently.
*   **üîó Full Menu Integration**: Control everything directly from the Tampermonkey script menu:
    *   `Edit System Instructions`: Open the editor.
    *   `Inject Instructions (from Menu)`: Run the injection sequence, perfect for when the button is hidden.
    *   `‚ñ∫ (Re)Show Button`: Easily bring the button back if you've hidden it permanently.
