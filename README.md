## ‚ú® Core Features

This script was built from the ground up to be smart, efficient, and unobtrusive.

- **üöÄ Instant, Flicker-Free Check**: On page load and between navigating chats, the script performs an instant check by reading the page's state. The UI button **only appears if your instructions aren't already there**, giving you a completely clean workspace.
- **‚ö° 'One-Shot' Workflow**: A single click on the sleek bottom-tab button performs a full sequence: it opens the panel, injects your text, closes the panel, and then hides itself.
- **üîí Safety First**: Intelligently detects if instructions already exist. Instead of blindly overwriting, it presents a clean confirmation dialog (`Overwrite` / `Cancel`) to protect your work.
- **üé® Professional UI**: Replaces all ugly native browser `prompt()` and `alert()` boxes with a custom-themed, non-blocking UI, including modals and toast notifications that match the AI Studio aesthetic.
- **üß† SPA-Aware**: Fully aware of AI Studio's single-page application structure. The script automatically re-runs its check whenever you switch between different chats, ensuring it's always relevant to the conversation you're in.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Total Control & Customization**:
    - **First Run Setup**: On first use, it prompts you to set your own default instructions.
    - **Easy Editing**: Edit your saved instructions anytime via a right-click on the button or a dedicated command in the Tampermonkey menu.
    - **Closable Button**: Don't want to see the button? Click the '√ó' to hide it for the session or permanently.
    - **Full Menu Integration**: Control everything from the Tampermonkey menu, including editing, direct injection (perfect if the button is hidden), and an option to re-show the button if you've hidden it forever.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Use

- **First Use**: Upon first launch, a professional-looking dialog will appear, asking you to enter and save your custom system instructions. This text will be saved locally in your browser.

- **Editing Instructions**:
  - **Method 1**: Right-click the "INJECTOR" button.
  - **Method 2**: Click the Tampermonkey extension icon in your browser, and select "Edit System Instructions".
- **Hiding/Showing the Button**:
